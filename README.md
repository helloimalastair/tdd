# Shopping Cart

Develop a shopping cart system using test-driven development. The system should allow users to add, remove, and update items in their shopping cart. The shopping cart should also calculate and display the total cost of all items in the cart.

Steps to follow:

1. Write tests for each functionality of the shopping cart system. This includes adding, and removing, as well as calculating the total cost.
1. Implement the code for each functionality of the shopping cart system, but don't forget to write only the code needed to make the tests pass.
1. Refactor the code as necessary to improve its readability and maintainability.
1. Re-run the tests to ensure that all functionality is still working as intended after refactoring.
1. Repeat steps 2-4 until you have a fully functioning shopping cart system that passes all tests.
1. Finally, showcase your test-driven development approach by presenting the tests you have written and demonstrating the functionality of the shopping cart system.
